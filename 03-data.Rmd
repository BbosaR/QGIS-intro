# Downloading and loading data {#data}

A vital skill for doing using GIS skills to solve real-world problems is finding, downloading and importing data.

Often, the first stage in the data downloading/loading process is to find the data online. 
In this case we will access data from the following site, which contains data we prepared earlier for the course: [github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases/download/v1.1).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(!dir.exists("QGISforSSPAdata/")) {
  u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases/download/v1.1/QGISforSSPAdata.zip"
  download.file(u, "QGISforSSPAdata.zip")
  unzip("QGISforSSPAdata.zip")
}
```

Look at the file in your explorer...

To open a file in QGIS first create a QGIS project.

To load a geographic data file, click on the Data Source Manager button in the top left corner of QGIS (see Figure \@ref(fig:data-source-manager)).

```{r data-source-manager, out.width="50%", fig.cap="The Data Source Manager icon", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/open-data-source-manager.png")
```
