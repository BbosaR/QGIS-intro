# Downloading and loading data {#data}

A vital skill for doing using GIS skills to solve real-world problems is finding, downloading and importing data.

Often, the first stage in the data downloading/loading process is to find the data online. 
In this case we will access data from the following site, which contains data we prepared earlier for the course: [github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases/download/v1.1).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(!dir.exists("QGISforSSPAdata/")) {
  u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases/download/v1.1/QGISforSSPAdata.zip"
  download.file(u, "QGISforSSPAdata.zip")
  unzip("QGISforSSPAdata.zip")
}
```

Look at the file in your explorer...

To open a file in QGIS first create a QGIS project.


## Importing spatial data

To load a spatial data file, click on the Data Source Manager button in the top left corner of QGIS (see Figure \@ref(fig:data-source-manager)).

```{r data-source-manager, out.width="50%", fig.cap="The Data Source Manager icon", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/open-data-source-manager.jpg")
```

We will use the leeds_lsoa.shp example file to plot the boundaries of the Lower Layer Super Output Areas in Leeds.

Open the Data Source Manager and select “Vector” then specify the “File Name” and location, or use the … to navigate to the file.

Click “Add” then “Close”.

```{r data-source-manager-shp, out.width="50%", fig.cap="The Data Source Manager - Vector", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/import_shp.jpg")
```


## Importing a CSV or text file

Sometimes you have data that contains spatial information but is not in a spatial data format.  A common example is to have a CSV file with latitude and longitude columns. CSV is a common format for storing data and can be opened by lots of different software, including Microsoft Excel. 
We will use the stats19.csv example file to plot the location of vehicles collisions in Leeds.

Open the Data Source Manager and select “Delimited Text” then specify the “File Name” and location, or use the … to navigate to the file.
Under the “Geometry definition” select “Point coordinates” and set the “X field” to “longitude” and the “Y field” to “latitude”.  Set the “Geometry CRS” to “EPSG: 4326 – WGS 84”.

Click “Add” then “Close”.

```{r data-source-manager-csv, out.width="50%", fig.cap="The Data Source Manager - Delimited Text", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/import_csv.jpg")
```
