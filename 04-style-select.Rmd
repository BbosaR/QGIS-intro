# Style and select features

## Identify Features

The Identify features button allow you to interogate a specific part of your spatial data simply by clicking on it

```{r idetify, out.width="10%", fig.cap="Identify Features Button", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/identify.jpg")
```

Clicking on a map feature brings up a pannel with more infroamtion about that feature. You can use the mode menu at the bottom of the pannel to select which layers will be included.

```{r identify_pannel, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Identify Features Pannel", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inspect_pannel.png")
```

## Symbology

In QGIS ou can change the apperance of layers to comunicate additonal information. This is called symbology.

In the layers pannel right click on "stats19" and select "properties", in the menu on the left select "Symbology"

```{r symbology_menu, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Symbology Menu", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/symbology.png")
```

For the type of Sybology select "Categorised", the column "accident_severity", then chose a colour ramp from the drop dwon menu. Then click "Classify". This will add all the different possible values from the data and assign each a unique colour. Click OK to return to the map.

```{r symbology_results, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Road collisons categoried by severity", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/symbology_results.png")
```

Experiment using different columns and types of symbology.
