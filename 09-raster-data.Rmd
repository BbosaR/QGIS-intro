# Making maps

While it is useful to view maps within QGIS it is usually necessary to export the maps pro printing to be included in a report.

From the project menu select "New Print Layout", you will be asked to give your new layout a name. You will see a blank page.

```{r print-layout, fig.cap="The print layout window, highlighting the add new map button", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/print-layout.png")
```

Use the "Add new map button" to draw a box where you wish you map to be on the page. Your map will appear within the box automatically.


```{r print-withmap, fig.cap="The print layout window, with map added", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/print-withmap.png")
```

You can pan and zoom within the map using the Move Item Content button

```{r move-item-conten, fig.cap="Move Item content button", out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/move-item-content.JPG")
```

You can add several different features to the print layout such as titles, legends and scale bars using the buttons on the left side of the window. When an objected is selected you can edit its properties by using the "Item Properties" tab on the right side panel. 

```{r print-custom, fig.cap="A customised map", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/print-custom.png")
```

## Saving & Exporting your map

You can save a map layout for later use using the save button on the main toolbar or using "Save project" in the "layout" menu. You can export your image in one of three formats.

* Export as Image - A range of different formats including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIF etc
* Export as PDF - A PDF document
* Export as SVG - A Scalable Vector Graphics image

All of these options and the option to print your map directly are in the "layout" menu.
