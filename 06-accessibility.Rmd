# Accessibility analysis

Accessibility is a key concept in transport planning.
One of the key aims of many transport policies is to make places more accessible to people, whether that's shops, schools or hospitals.
But what does that actually mean?

In this example, we will use QGIS to explore accessibility to cycle infrastructure.
Although this is an unnusual measure of accessibility, the methods can be modified and extended to explore other types of accessibility, for example accessibility to schools before and after 'school agglomeration', the topic of an academic paper based on a case study in Sao Paulo, Brazil [@moreno-monroy_public_2017].

## Input data

Building on previous chapters, we will use a case study of Leeds.
There are two additional datasets we'll use for this, saved in the file `data_accessibility.zip` in the releases section of the tutorial.

```{}

```

The input datasets were taken from 2 places:

- The cycle infrastructure data was taken from they Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Tool ([CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike))
- The desire lines data were taken from the propensity to cycle tool (see [pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire](http://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire)) [@lovelace_propensity_2017].

Following the guidance in previous chapters, we *pre-processed* these datasets in 2 ways:

- Reproject the datasets so they are in the British National Grid CRS (EPSG:27700)
- Subset the desire lines so that we only have the top 200 across West Yorksire

Download and unzip the `data_accessibility.zip` file and load the `.gpkg` files.
As a taster of what we will do, and to check you have the right input data, the results should look something like the map shown in Figure \@ref(fig:access-overview).
