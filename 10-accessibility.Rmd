# Accessibility analysis

Accessibility is a key concept in transport planning.
One of the key aims of many transport policies is to make places more accessible to people, whether that's shops, schools or hospitals.
But what does that actually mean?

In this example, we will use QGIS to explore accessibility to cycle infrastructure.
Although this is an unnusual measure of accessibility, the methods can be modified and extended to explore other types of accessibility, for example accessibility to schools before and after 'school agglomeration', the topic of an academic paper based on a case study in Sao Paulo, Brazil [@moreno-monroy_public_2017].

## Input data

Building on previous chapters, we will use a case study of Leeds.
There are two additional datasets we'll use for this, saved in the file `data_accessibility.zip` in the releases section of the tutorial.

```{}

```

The input datasets were taken from 2 places:

- The cycle infrastructure data was taken from they Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Tool ([CyIPT](https://www.cyipt.bike))
- The desire lines data were taken from the propensity to cycle tool (see [pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire](http://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire)) [@lovelace_propensity_2017].

Following the guidance in previous chapters, we *pre-processed* these datasets in 2 ways:

- Reproject the datasets so they are in the British National Grid CRS (EPSG:27700)
- Subset the desire lines so that we only have the top 200 across West Yorksire

Download and unzip the `data_accessibility.zip` file and load the `.gpkg` files.
As a taster of what we will do, and to check you have the right input data, the results should look something like the map shown in Figure \@ref(fig:access-overview).

```{r access-overview, fig.cap="Overview of input data for this chapter."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/access-overview.png")
```

## Identify areas in Leeds with some cycle infrastructure

A simple but effective way of comparing 2 geographic layers, as a first step towards an accessibility indicator, is a spatial selection.
We can do this to identify zones that have access to *at least some cycle infrastructure*:

- Use the Select by location tool to select only those LSOAs with at least some cycleways in
- Do this with the following menu options: Vector > Research Tools > Select by Location
- Save the result as a new layer called, for example, `leeds_lsoa_cycleway`

The result should look like that shown in Figure \@ref(fig:select-by-location).

```{r select-by-location, fig.cap="Select by Location: results."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/select-by-location.png")
```

- What proportion of zones have at least some cycle infrastructure, according to this measure?
- What are the limitations of this approach?

<!-- ## Ideas from Malcolm -->

<!-- 1. Install the ORS Tools Plugin -->
<!-- 1. Signup for an API token at openrouteservice.org -->
<!-- 1. Add token to ORS Tools Settings -->
<!-- 1. Download the locations of schools from ??? -->
<!-- 1. Buffer schools and find population within 1km of a school -->
<!-- 1. Make isochone for 10, 20, 30 min cycle from schools -->
<!-- 1. Dissolve isochone togther  -->
<!-- 1. may need to change nerndering order (properties -> symbology -> layerrendering) -->
<!-- 1. use geoprocessing v.clean (with clean type break) -->
<!-- 1. edit polygons to remove the unneeded sections -->
<!-- 1. join the isochones onto the points -->
