## How to install QGIS on your own computer

If you cannot access QGIS at work or at an educational establishment, you will need to install it on your computer.

For instructions on installing QGIS, see [download.qgis.org/](https://download.qgis.org/).  


Here you can download QGIS for Windows, Mac and other operating systems.
For most people running Windows, clicking on the [OSGeo4W](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe) download link and installing this version is recommended.
The OSGeo4W version includes additional features beyond those included in the initial install.  

If you use other operating systems, or want a smaller installation, we recommend the options headed "Long term release repository (most stable)"
