## How to install QGIS on your own computer
The simplest way to install QGIS is from [download.qgis.org/](https://download.qgis.org/).  


Here you can download for windows Mac and other operating systems.  Initially, we recommend the option headed "Long term release repository (most stable):".  


There are other ways to download QGIS for windows for example from  [OSGeo4W](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe) package, which includes additional features which you might not need straight away but which may become useful later.
