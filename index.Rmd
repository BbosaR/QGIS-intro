# Preface {-}



## What is this resource?  

This resource is in two parts and accompanies teaching delivered on [MSc degrees in  transport](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport-masters) to students at the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) at the University of Leeds. 

### Part 1 is an introduction to GIS for transport students 

This workbook contains information about getting started using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) using the QGIS application.  It assumes no prior knowledge of either GIS concepts or experience of using GIS applications.  


### Part 1 Pre-requisites {-}

**If you are an ITS student** 
This part has no pre-requisites:  It is aimed at students little or no experience of using any GIS software and those who are new to the open source software called QGIS.  
The materials accompany a semester 1 face-to-face workshop for ITS Students, but, they are designed for students to work through at their own pace.  This means that if you do not attend the workshop, you can still make use of the resources.  

**If you are not an ITS student or you are not at the face to face workshop**
This course assumes that you have access to a working installation of QGIS 3 and an internet connection.
We will explain how to download the data needed for the practicals in Chapter \@ref(data).




### Part 2 is key QGIS skills for transport students studying Sustainable Spatial Planning and Analysis.

[Sustainable Spatial Planning and Analysis](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=201920&M=TRAN-5115M) is a second semester MSc module taught at ITS.  
Part 2 covers key skills required by students on this course.  These materials accompany a face to face workshop delivered as part of the module.  

### Part 2 pre-requisites {-}
The pre-requisite for this part is to be familiar with the ideas and skills covered in part 1.  

## The aim of this resource: Why are we teaching GIS? 
We are teaching transport GIS because transport is an inherently geographic phenomena. All transport involves movement from one place on Earth to another, whether its by walking, flying or telecommunications.  Those movements and flows impact and are impacted upon by the people and places along the routes.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) therefore have great potential to assist transport researchers and practitioners.  We are teaching QGIS.  Which is free and open source.




<!-- ## Structure of the book {-} -->

  <!-- Chapters \@ref(Part1) introduces GIS and the program QGIS... -->

  <!-- ## Software information and conventions {-} -->

  <!-- I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below: -->

  <!-- ```{r} -->
  <!-- xfun::session_info() -->
  <!-- ``` -->

  <!-- Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`). -->
