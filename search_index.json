That may sound like a minor change, but it meant that previous materials, developed by Ian Philips, were no longer up-to-date. More importantly, some of the instructions simply failed on the latest version of QGIS. Instead of incrementally updating those materials we decided to start from scratch. The aim is to get you up-to-speed with the most important concepts and techniques in QGIS for Transport Planning. We refer to Transport Planning in the broad sense of providing evidence-based guidance to support sustainable transport behaviours. With air pollution, the obesity crisis, and growing levels of economic inequality in cities worldwide, this inevitably means investment in walking, cycling and public transport. For this reason the data used in this booklet focusses on these modes. Pre-requisites What you need to have… Structure of the book Chapters 1 introduces GIS and the program QGIS… "],

Often, the first stage in the data downloading/loading process is to find the data online. In this case we will access data from the following site, which contains data we prepared earlier for the course: github.com/ITSLeeds/SSPA/releases. Look at the file in your explorer… To open a file in QGIS first create a QGIS project. To load a geographic data file, click on the Data Source Manager button in the top left corner of QGIS (see Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: The Data Source Manager icon "],
