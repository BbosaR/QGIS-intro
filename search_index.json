That may sound like a minor change, but it meant that previous materials were no longer up-to-date. Vitally, it meant that some of the instructions simply failed on the latest version of QGIS running on the computers in the ‘clusters’ where many practical sessions in ITS are taught. Instead of incrementally updating those materials we decided to start from from a blank slate, allowing the inclusion of new datasets and links to excellent on-line content that already exists for QGIS. The aim is to get you up-to-speed with the most important concepts and techniques in QGIS for Transport Planning. We refer to Transport Planning in the broad sense of providing evidence-based guidance to support sustainable transport behaviours. With air pollution, the obesity crisis, and growing levels of economic inequality in cities worldwide, this inevitably means investment in walking, cycling and public transport. For this reason the data used in this booklet focusses on these modes. Pre-requisites This course assumes that you have access to a working installation of QGIS 3 and an internet connection. We will explain how to download the data needed for the practicals in Chapter ??. "]
